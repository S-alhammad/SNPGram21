# SNPGram21 Dataset
This is the official repository for the SNPGram21 dataset introduced in the ICPR2022 paper: Efficient Cell Labelling for Gram Stain WSIs. 

# Dataset Creation
This dataset was constructed in collaboration with Sullivan Nicolades Pathology (SNP) from routine clinical samples. WSI samples are from 6 groups including Skin, Respiratory, Fluids, Hospital, Genital, and Ear/Eye/Nose/Throat. 
SNPGram21 includes 100 Whole Slide Gram Stain Images used in the clinical investigation of infections. The slides are automatically scanned without using oil immersion at 63 magnification. Each WSI is compressed to JPEG format. Leukcytes and epithelial cells are annotated using bounding boxes.
